                    “As late as 1976, a 500 pound life sized bronze water nymph 
                    mysteriously disappeared from her base on Swan Island in the 
                    front lagoon, the victim, perhaps, of thieves, or of pranksters 
                    who may have lost the dead weight in the black of night.  Its’ 
                    fate, like its origin, is still unknown.”

                    When I was a child I lived on Sherwood Forest Drive a block from 
                    City Park. I grew up looking at the empty pedestal, it captured my 
                    ation and I wondered what had been there. The pedestal was still 
                    there when I moved back into the neighborhood 35 years later.

                    A couple of years ago I was approached by Michael Manjarris to 
                    participate in Sculpture for New Orleans, a program which is 
                    responsible for the art on the Poydras corridor as well as various 
                    sites around the city.  My first thought was of the empty pedestal. 
                    I wanted to replace what had been lost but instead of celebrating 
                    the story of an abduction I thought to change the story into one 
                    in which the girl left the island of her own volition, traveled the 
                    world and after four decades of exploration realized there is no place 
                    she’s rather be than mid-city, the heart of New Orleans.

                    I proposed to create a six foot bronze sculpture of the woman the 
                    girl became but wanted to reference the original statue. I contacted 
                    the museum and City Park but neither had record or images of the 
                    little girl. I also spent hours researching at the Historic New Orleans 
                    Collection where I found a book called Sculpture in New Orleans that 
                    cataloged all of the statues around town. The center two page spread 
                    had three photographs of female statues in which the caption read: 
                    “The statues in Audubon Park are beautiful”. I knew two of the 
                    statues: one in the fountain at the front of the park facing Tulane 
                    and Hygia, the fountain in Audubon Zoo.  The third picture was of a 
                    little girl with a hand outstretched. I knew that was the girl but 
                    need confirmation.

                    During my research I also interviewed neighbors who remembered the 
                    statue. One said it had a water feature- that the water came out of 
                    her hand. I asked Barry Kaiser, a photographer I work with if he 
                    remembered the theft. He said he remembered it but did not have a 
                    photo of the original statue. But he knew someone who did. I 
                    contacted his friend, Owen Murphy, who sent me a photo of a statue 
                    of a little girl with her hand outstretched- it was the same statue 
                    as the one in the book inaccurately labeled as being in Audubon Park.

                    The piece, called Grace, is a female form that demonstrates strength 
                    through adversity as well as how we are shaped by our experiences and 
                    the power of home.
