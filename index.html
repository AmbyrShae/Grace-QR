                                mysteriously disappeared from her base on Swan Island in the 
                                front lagoon, the victim, perhaps, of thieves, or of pranksters 
                                who may have lost the dead weight in the black of night.  Its

                        <p>
                                As a child, I lived on Sherwood Forest Drive a block from City Park. I grew up looking at an empty pedestal. It captured
                                my imagination and I wondered what had been there. The pedestal was still there when I moved back
                                into the neighborhood 35 years later.
                        </p>

                                A couple of years ago I was approached by Michael Manjarris to participate in Sculpture for New Orleans, a program which
                                is responsible for the art on the Poydras corridor as well as various sites around the city.
                                My first thought was of the empty pedestal. I wanted to replace what had been lost but instead
                                of telling a story of an abduction I thought to change the story into one in which
                                the girl left the island of her own volition, traveled the world and, after four decades of
                                exploration, realized there is no place she’d rather be than mid-city, the heart of New Orleans.

                                I proposed to create a six foot bronze sculpture of the woman the girl became but wanted to reference the original statue.
                                I contacted the museum and City Park but neither had records or images of the little girl.
                                I spent hours researching at the Historic New Orleans Collection where I found a book
                                called Sculpture in New Orleans that cataloged all of the statues around town. The center
                                two-page spread had three photographs of female statues in which the caption read: <em>“The statues
                                in Audubon Park are beautiful.”</em> I knew two of the statues: one in the fountain at the front
                                of the park facing Tulane and Hygia and the other the fountain in Audubon Zoo. The third picture was of
                                a little girl with a hand outstretched. I knew that was the girl but needed confirmation.

                                During my research I interviewed neighbors who remembered the statue. One said it had a water feature -- that the water
                                came out of her hand. I asked Barry Kaiser, a photographer I work with if he remembered the
                                theft. He said he remembered it but did not have a photo of the original statue. However, he knew
                                someone who did. I contacted his friend, Owen Murphy, who sent me a photo of a statue of
                                a little girl with her hand outstretched- it was the same statue as the one in the book inaccurately
                                labeled as being in Audubon Park.

                                experiences and the power of home.
